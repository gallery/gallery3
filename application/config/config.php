 * the path, and a site_protocol is specified, the domain will be auto-detected.
 *
 * Here we do our best to autodetect the base path to Gallery.  If your url is something like:
 *   http://example.com/gallery3/index.php/album73/photo5.jpg?param=value
 *
 * We want the site_domain to be:
 *   /gallery3
 *
 * In the above example, $_SERVER["SCRIPT_NAME"] contains "/gallery3/index.php" so
 * dirname($_SERVER["SCRIPT_NAME"]) is what we need.  Except some low end hosts (namely 1and1.com)
 * break SCRIPT_NAME and it contains the extra path info, so in the above example it'd be:
 *   /gallery3/index.php/album73/photo5.jpg
 *
 * So dirname doesn't work.  So we do a tricky workaround where we look up the SCRIPT_FILENAME (in
 * this case it'd be "index.php" and we delete from that part onwards.  If you work at 1and1 and
 * you're reading this, please fix this bug!
