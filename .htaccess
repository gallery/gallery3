# Increase security by uncommenting this block.  It keeps browsers

# You can use the mod_rewrite Apache module to get rid of the
# "index.php" from your Gallery 3 urls.  Uncomment the block below
# inside the <IfModule> ... </IfModule> lines and then edit the
# RewriteBase line to match your Gallery 3 URL.
#
# Here are some RewriteBase values:
#   Gallery 3 URL                       RewriteBase line
#   =============                       ====================
#   http://example.com/gallery3         RewriteBase /gallery3
#   http://example.com/~bob/photos      RewriteBase /~bob/photos
#   http://gallery3.example.com/        RewriteBase /
#
# Then just use your Gallery 3 without the index.php in the url.
#
# NOTE: future upgrades of Gallery 3 will overwrite this file!  If you
# want these changes to be persistent, talk to your system admin about
# putting this block into your Apache config files.
