/**
 * These are hacked versions of Kohana's Upload::save() and Upload::not_empty() that bypass
 * security.  We use them in unit testing to allow us to fake file uploads (e.g. Watermarks)
 * without PHP's is_uploaded_file() and move_uploaded_file() correctly identifying that
 * they're invalid.  By design, these functions are quite secure and, consequently, do not
 * have any simple workarounds.
 *
 * For clarity, below are verbatim copies of the original functions with the relevant pieces
 * commented out (identified with "// EDIT:..."), which still use Kohana-style formatting.
