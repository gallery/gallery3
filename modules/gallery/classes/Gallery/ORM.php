   * into the existing set.  This is useful when we're installing a module but it's not yet
   * active and cannot be reached by Module::event()
   *
   * We populate the relationships cache by running the "model_relationships" event then use the
   * cache to define the relationships of new model instances.  Since the cache is static, it only
   * needs to be populated once.  Note that we only populate (and use) the cache once we've run
   * Module::load_modules().  This means that it's not easy to add relationships to Model_Module
   * or Model_Var using this method since they're used in the Module class to load the modules in
   * the first place.  Similar to the object name, we set the foreign model names using our
   * method.
   *
   * Example: a module wants to establish a "has_many through" relationship between its foo model
   * and the item model using the pivot table "items_foo_bars".  In the module's event hook, we have:
   *   function model_relationships($relationships) {

   *     $relationships["foo_bar"]["has_many"]["items"] = array("through" => "items_foo_bars");
   *   }
   * This will map "Model_Item" and "Model_FooBar" with object names "item" and "foo_bar" to DB
   * tables "items" and "foo_bars" with a DB pivot table "items_foo_bars" that has columns "item_id"
   * and "foo_bar_id".  For more information, see Kohana's ORM relationships documentation.
