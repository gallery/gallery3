   * This resource represents a collection of item resources.

   * GET can accept the following query parameters:
   *   ancestors_for=url
   *     Return the ancestors of the specified item.  If specified,
   *     all other query parameters described below will be ignored.
   *     This is typically used to create breadcrumbs for an item.
   *   urls=["url1","url2","url3"]
   *     Return items that match the specified urls.  If specified,
   *     the "start" and "num" parameters will be ignored.
   *     This is typically used to return the member detail.
   *   name=<substring>
   *     Only return items where the name contains this substring.
   *   type=<comma-separated list of photo, movie or album>
   *     Limit the type to types in this list (e.g. "type=photo,movie").
   *     Also limits the types returned in the member collections (i.e. sub-albums).
   *   @see  Controller_Rest_Items::get_members()
   *
   * POST *requires* the following post parameters:
   *   entity
   *     Add an item, using the "parent" field as its parent.
   *   file
   *     Add an item's data file (only for movies and photos)
   *   @see  Controller_Rest_Items::post_entity()
   *
   * Notes:
   *   Unlike other collections, "expand_members" is true by default (backward-compatible with v3.0).
   *   @see  Controller_Rest_Items::action_get()
